## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single-quote characters in arguments (e.g. I'm Groot), use PowerShell-safe quoting: e.g. `'I''m Groot'` or simply `"I'm Groot"`.
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```powershell
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

**ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL**

1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote.

**UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL**
